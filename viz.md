## Visualizations

Overview of a sentence:

- "Ahnentafel"-like indentation for subordination of verbal units. Possibly highlighting of certain elements.  Consider SVO in strong text, other elements in light text?
- Class style display: tokens remains in text order but are on lines with indentation by VU.  Perhaps link split VUs somehow? (Color? arrows?)
- Tree of VUs, with full text of each (wrapped?) displayed



Understanding a VU:

- SVO on a line with subordination of other units? (Adverbial or adjectival)
