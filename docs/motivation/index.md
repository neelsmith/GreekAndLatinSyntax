# Motivation

The syntactic system of ancient Greek is complex, and there are no native speakers to appeal to for help understanding it.  A formal model of Greek syntax that can be applied to digital texts in Greek could have great benefits for the teaching and study of ancient Greek.

We are not yet at a stage where we can computationally infer the syntax of texts reliably.

The model described in these pages differs in several respects from the syntactic analysis of existing hand-tagged syntax trees for Greek.
