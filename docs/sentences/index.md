# Sentences

Sentences occur in a larger [textual context](../texts/).

Model:

- identified by a CTS URN with a range expression cited at the token level
- have one or more *[verbal units](../verbal_units/)*
- exactly one verbal unit is of the type *independent clause* (AKA "principal", "main" clause)
- every sentence has a connector value that is either the CTS URN of connecting token (conjunction or particle) or a value of `nothing` for asyndeton.
