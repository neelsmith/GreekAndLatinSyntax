# Modelling Greek syntax

We analyze Greek syntax at four hierarchical levels.  We identify the textual context at each level with CTS URNs, and annotate each level as follows:


1. texts.  We annotate its orthgraphic system
2. sentences
3. verbal units
4. tokens

## More details

See the linked sections for fuller information about the model for each hierarchical level.
