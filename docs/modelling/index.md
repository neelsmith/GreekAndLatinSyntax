# Modelling Greek syntax

We analyze Greek syntax at four hierarchical levels, and identify the textual context at each level with CTS URNs.

Each level incorporates a set of elements at the lower level: text contains sentences, sentences contain verbal units, and verbal units contain tokens.  Tokens include textual content.

In addition, we make the following annotations specific to each level:


1. *Text*.  We annotate its orthgraphic system.
2. *Sentence*. We annotate its coordination with surrounding context.
3. *Verbal unit*. We annotate its semantic type, syntactic type, and level of subordination.
4. *Token*. We model contents as a citable passage of text, and annotate each token with a token type, and type-dependent morphological and syntactic analyses.
