# Sentences

Sentences occur in a larger [textual context](../texts/).  We identify the place of a sentence in this context with a CTS URN citing a range of *tokens* at the token level.

In ancient Greek, sentences are normally explicitly related to each through the use of a coordinating conjunction or particle.  We explicitly identify the syntactic coordination of a sentence with its context with *either* a CTS URN at the token level identifying the coordinating conjunction or particle, *or* the value `nothing`. The value `nothing` explicitly indicates asyndeton, the syntactically unmarked connection of a sentence to its context.

The further structure of a sentence is organized as a series of one or more *verbal units*. At least one verbal unit is of the type *independent clause*.  Read more information about the structure of [verbal units](../verbal_units/).
