# Verbal units

A *verbal unit* is a verbal idea with a subject and predicate (either of which might be implicit or explicit). We annotate each verbal unit with

- semantic type
- syntactic type
- level of subordination


## Semantic type

We annotate the *semantic type* of a verbal expression as one of:

- transitive
- intransitive
- linking


## Syntactic type

We also annotate the *syntactic type* of a verbal expression.  For each syntactic type, the following table summarizes the syntax of its construction, and of its connection to its larger context. (In all cases, either subject or predicate may be explicitly expressed or may be implied.)

| Type | Verbal construction |  Syntactic connection to context |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **main clause** | finite verb with nominative subject | coordinating particle or conjunction, or asyndeton |
| **subordinate clause** | finite verb with nominative subject | subordinating conjunction |
| **circumstantial participle** | participial form agreeing with a substantive functioning as subject of the verbal idea | agreement in gender, case, number with subject |
| **attributive participle** | participial form agreeing   with a substantive functioning as subject of the verbal idea | participle related to subject substantive by being in attributive position |
| **indirect statement with infinitive** | accusative subject  plus infinitive, or nominative subject if the same as subject of superior clause  | verb of superior clause expresses speaking, thinking, believing|
| **indirect statement with participle** | accusative subject  plus participle| verb of superior clause expresses perceiving or knowing |

Every [sentence](../sentences/) has one verbal unit of type *main clause*.  T



## Level of subordination

We annotate each verbal unit with an integer indication the level of subordination of the verbal unit.

Within the context of a sentence, only one verbal unit is independent.  Its level of subordination is 1. All other verbal units depend syntactically on another verbal unit, and have a level of subordination 1 greater than the unit they depend on.



## Content

The content of a verbal unit is represented by a set of [*tokens*](../tokens/).
