# Verbal units

A *verbal unit* is a verbal idea with a subject and predicate (either of which might be implicit or explicit).  



The construction of the subject and predicate depend on the type of the verbal unit, as summarized here:

| Type | Verbal construction |  Syntactic connection to context |
| --- | --- | --- |
| main clause | finite verb with nominative subject | coordinating particle or conjunction, or asyndeton |
| subordinate clause | finitive verb with nominative subject | subordinating conjunction |
| circumstantial participle | participial form agreeing   with a substantive functioning as subject of the verbal idea | agreement in gender, case, number with subject |
| attributive participle | participial form agreeing   with a substantive functioning as subject of the verbal idea | participle in attributive position |
| indirect statement with infinitive | accusative subject  plus infinitive, or nominative subject is same as subject of superior clause  | verb of superior clause expresses speaking, thinking, believing|
| indirect statement with participle | accusative subject  plus participle| verb of superior clause expresses perceiving or knowing |

Every [sentence](../sentences/) has one verbal unit of type *main clause*.  T

Model:

- type of verbal unit: one of
    
- type of verbal semantics: one of
    - transitive verb
    - intransitive verb 
    - linking verb
- a integer value for level of subordination
- a set of [*tokens*](../tokens/)


## Structure of verbal units by type

- all clauses have a finite verb (expressed or implied), with nominative subject (expressed or implied)
- indirect statements have accusative subject (expressed or implied) 
- participial verbal
