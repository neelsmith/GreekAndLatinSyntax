# Texts

Ancient Greek is a historical language.  We study its syntax from source texts, and analyze them to create analyzed texts.

## Source texts

We follow the CITE architecture model for the *structure* of texts.  In this model, texts are organized as an ordered sequence of logical units in a citation hierarchy.  This model is sufficiently general to apply to any citable text, but says nothing about the contents of citable units.  They could be treated simply as a stream of characters or bytes.

## Analyzed texts

Analyzed texts have a specified [orthography](../orthography/), and are organized into a series of sentences.

Our definition of *sentence* is semantic: it is a textual expression capable of standing alone as a complete idea.  While this concept is generic, [our application of it to Greek](../sentences/) is specific to Greek syntax.
