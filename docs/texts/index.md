# Texts

Ancient Greek is a historical language.  We study its syntax from source texts, and analyze them to create analyzed texts.

## Source texts

CITE model of structure: an ordered sequence of logical units in a citation hierarchy.

Sufficiently general to apply to any text.

Says nothing about contents!

## Analyzed texts

Analyzed texts have a specified orthography, and are organized into a series of sentences.

### Orthography

An orthography has the following functionality:

- enumerate character set
- evaluate if a sequence of characters is orthographically valid
- enumerate set of token types
- parse a stream of valid characters into a sequence of classified tokens citable at the level of the token (i.e., extending the canonical citation hierarchy one level)


This definition is generic enough to appy to many languages (any language?).

### Sentences

By *sentence*, we mean a textual expression capable of standing alone as complete idea.  The concept is generic, but [our realization of it](../sentences/) must be specific to Greek.
